# alloy-rlp-derive

This crate provides derive macros for traits defined in
[`alloy-rlp`](https://docs.rs/alloy-rlp). See that crate's documentation for
more information.

## Provenance note

This crate was originally part of the [reth] project, as [`reth_rlp`].

This was forked from an earlier Apache-licensed version of the
[`fastrlp`] crate, before it changed licence to GPL.
The Rust `fastrlp` implementation is itself a port of the [Golang Apache-licensed fastrlp][gofastrlp].
