## RLP derive crate

This crate provides derive macros for traits defined in
[`ethers-rlp`](https://docs.rs/ethers-rlp). See that crate's documentation for
more information.

### Provenance notes

This crate was originally part of the
[reth](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/) project. Maintenance has been
taken over by the ethers developers.

Forked from an earlier Apache licenced version of the `fastrlp-derive` crate,
before it changed licence to GPL. NOTE: The Rust fastrlp implementation is
itself a port of the
[Golang Apache licensed fastrlp](https://github.com/umbracle/fastrlp)
